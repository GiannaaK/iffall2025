      <h1>Who is : Gianna Kim?</h1>
      
      <p><Strong>Name, Major, Year in school: </Strong></p>
      <p>Gianna Kim, Communication Design and Marketing, CO2027</p>
      
      <p><Strong>My Background & Motivation to take this class </Strong></p>
      <p>As a student aspiring to build a career in digital marketing and design, I realized the importance of understanding computer coding during my internship, where I was tasked with designing and building the company’s homepage. I believe this course will help me learn how to create effective communication through code while enhancing the visual aesthetics of digital interfaces.</p>

      <p><Strong>Experience with HTML/CSS/JShool: </Strong></p>
      <p>I have some experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from a design class I took in high school, where we built websites and apps using these languages. I really enjoyed the class, even though I often referenced to W3Schools and YouTube tutorials. Additionally, I have a somewhat more in-depth understanding of coding from completing an Introduction to Computer Science course.</p>
    
      <p><Strong>One thing I hope to learn in class </Strong></p>
      <p>I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how each coding element functions and contributes to specific features, rather than simply copying and pasting code with minimal adjustments.</p>
    
      <p><Strong>One way I expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper: </Strong></p>
      <p>Since the screen is a more flexible platform, I hope to design interactive features, such as engaging animations and clickable elements.</p>

      <p><Strong>A website with effective design: </Strong></p>
      <p><a href="url">https://www.chungiyoo.com/</a>| Very interactive, dynamic movements with smooth transitions</p>
    
      <p><Strong>A website with effective communication: </Strong></p>
      <p><a href="url">https://www.orano.group/experience/innovation/en</a>| The structured, architectural animations effectively communicate the content and guide the viewer’s attention.</p>

      <p><Strong>A website that works well: </Strong></p>
      <p><a href="url">https://www.cartier.com/en-fr/watchesandwonders#</a>| Strong visual and animated communication, with smooth transitions that follow the cursor’s movement.</p>
